# java-masterclass-j17SE
Self Teaching and a Udemy Java masterclass, these are the coding challenges, tests and projects worked on. 
Any challenges were completed solo by me relying only on the material taught in class. 
If I needed help for a solution, I used resources to help me understand the concepts rather than copy and paste.
